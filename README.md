# COMP3000Project
Final Year Project COMP3000 "Using software to educate user's in cyber security and to help reduce security risks."

The project involves developing an android mobile application that educates user's in cyber security 
risks and good cyber security practices to potentially reduce security risks for that individual and 
improving their personal security. 

This repository contains the full working code of my application "Cyber multi tool" which has the features listed below.

1) Strong password generator – Generates a strong password for the user with the press of a button. 

2) Educational Quiz – Multiple choice quiz. 

3) Password strength checker – Allows the users to check the strength of an entered password.
